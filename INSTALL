In order to configure the MPI portion of the script, the following will need
to be set:

CXX - must be set to the MPI C++ compiler
PATH - May need to add the directory of the MPI C++ compiler wrapper
LD_LIBRARY_PATH - Set to the directory of the MPI libraries

Once this is complete, the next step is to run ./configure
